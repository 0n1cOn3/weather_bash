🌤️ **weather_bash**

A simple bash script that fetches a weather report for your location right into your terminal. ☔

#### Note:
  - This is just a straightforward script for myself to get the current weather right in the terminal, but feel free to use it as you like. 
It is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0. A considerable amount of uwu is present. 😎

## Anything Else to Know?

Further updates will most likely only be to fix something. I think this project is now complete. If you experience any issues with this script or want to suggest adding something, you are more than welcome!

**P.S: API keys are intentionally left as variables in the script so you can change them to your own or any other if they reach the request limit.**

## Discarded ideas

- Add ANSI/ASCII art as icons for weather descriptions
